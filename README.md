### NottAnotherAWSCDN
This project is intended to be the main source of Pokemon Card Images and relevant text (like names, set numbers, set names, etc) for a master set tracking project I intend to work on.

This is intended for myself to be able to track my master set progress for sets I am trying to complete.
